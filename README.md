# QuickEditorCompPhotoFinal
A simple photo editor allowing a user to zoom, create a panorama, and more. Collaborated on with others for a uni project.

Must have Kivy GUI installed with a Kivy virtual environment set up. Need Kivy libraries to run successfully.

Create a folder and put all these files into it, with Kivy libraries working, run from the home screen file.
